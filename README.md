### The TUI Anime List Manager

---

Tippy is a In Progress TUI Anime List Manager similar in vein to the Taiga software available in Windows.

#### Planned Features

 - Anime Listing
 - Searching of API using Anilist
 - Anime Information
 - Ability to connect to either Anilist or own DB

Simply a hobbyist project as of now, no plans as to distribution in what license to use this.

As this is my first project in Rust, should be pretty crude in actuality.
